# What’s the Fairest of Them All? Aesthetic Assessment of Visuals

# Abstract

Attractive images and videos are the visual backbone of journalism and social media. From trailers to teaser images to image galleries,appealing visuals have only grown in importance over the past years. Especially online, eye-catching visual content can signifi-cantly impact user engagement. However, selecting the best shots from a long video or selecting the perfect image from a vast image collection is a challenging and time-consuming task. This work presents a full-stack multimedia retrieval system for the aesthetic assessment of images and video content, leveraging deep learning models trained on photographers’ expertise. Our system assesses the aesthetic qualities of images and videos basedon features identified by experts from the media industry. The system is composed of two main components: a back-end component that extracts aesthetic features and a web front-end that allows the user to input the visuals and interact with the extracted features.The system is built into a containerized application to guarantee reproducibility.
